        ["Monitor","A monitor is an output device that displays information . It is also known as a screen, display, video display, or video screen. It displays the video and graphics information generated by the computer through the video card. The monitor is connected to the computer via a cable and receives power from a power source such as a battery or power outlet."],
        ["Keyboard","A keyboard is an input device that allows a person to enter letters, numbers, and other symbols (these are called characters) into a computer. It is one of the most used input devices for computers. With a keyboard we type a email, write a report, or play a game."],
        ["Mouse","A mouse is an input device that allows a person to interact with a computer. It is also known as a pointing device. It is called a mouse because of the wire that comes out of the back of it and looks like a tail, and also because it looks like the animal the mouse. "],

It is the primary component of the computer that contains the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and other essential components. Think of motherboard as a bus terminal, where all the other components interacted with each other. Each components talk to one another through the motherboard."], 
                ["CPU", "The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the part of a computer system that is commonly referred to as the 'brains' of a computer. The CPU takes information from the RAM (which will be discussed below) and figures out what to do with the information then sends them to other components. Without the CPU, the computer will not function."],

RAM is much faster to read from and write to than other kinds of storage in a computer, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD) or optical drive."],

Firmware is a software that is permanently stored in the computer's hardware. It is used to control the computer's hardware and software."],
                ["HDD", "HDD (Hard Disk Drive) is a data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rigid rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order and not only sequentially."],
                ["SDD", "SSD (Solid State Drive) is a type of storage device that uses non-volatile memory to hold data. Unlike HDD, SSD does not have any moving parts. This makes SSD faster and more reliable than HDD. SSD is also more expensive than HDD."],

GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing, and their highly parallel structure makes them more effective than general-purpose CPUs for algorithms where the processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel."],

The PSU converts electrical power from an external source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency needed by the computer's internal components. It also regulates the voltage to eliminate spikes and surges common in most electrical systems."],

They are used to read and write data from optical discs (CD, DVD, and Blu-ray). This is where you insert your CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc to install software or watch movies. Some optical drives can also write data to the disc. This is where you burn your CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc."],
